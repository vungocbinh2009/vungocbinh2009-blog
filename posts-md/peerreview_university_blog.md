> “At PRU, you don’t just succeed — you pass review.”  

Imagine a university where **literally everything** must be peer-reviewed. Not just papers — **your assignments, your lunch choices, your emotional outbursts, and even the mop used by custodial staff**. Welcome to **PeerReview University (PRU)** — the pinnacle of academic recursion.

## 🎓 Life at PRU

### 🧑‍🎓 Students:
- **Applying to PRU?** You submit a *structured proposal* — not an application.
- **Group projects** require citations, rebuttals, and IRB approval.
- **Asking a question in class?** Use the Class Question Submission Portal™. Response time: 2–6 weeks.
- **Final exam answers** are submitted for peer-reviewed publication in the *Journal of Undergraduate Mistakes (JUM)*.

### 🧑‍🏫 Professors:
- Must submit lecture slides to the **Pedagogical Integrity Board** with methodology and learning outcome metrics.
- Syllabus updates require a literature review and co-author approval.
- Grading is done via **triple-blind review** to prevent bias, favoritism, and recognition of handwriting.

### 🧑‍💼 Staff:
- Every email is peer-reviewed for tone, impact, and narrative flow.
- Event planning includes a 2-page proposal and at least 3 departmental citations.
- Coffee orders must pass a *taste audit committee*.

## 🧼 Custodial & Support Staff

- Cleaning schedules are decided based on Scopus-indexed janitorial studies.
- Mop selections must be meta-analyzed for absorbency and ethics.
- Complaints like "missed a spot" are processed via **Reviewer Comment Submission Form 14B**.

## 🧾 Appealing a Grade at PRU

**Grade appeals** are no joke — they are formal submissions involving:

1. Structured Abstract  
2. Literature Review on grading philosophy  
3. Annotated original answers with references  
4. Rebuttal letter addressing all reviewer feedback  

And yes — reviewers of your appeal are **themselves peer-reviewed**.

This triggers the **Recursive Peer Review Cycle™**:

- **Level 1**: Your grade appeal is reviewed.
- **Level 2**: Reviewers are peer-reviewed.
- **Level 3**: Meta-reviewers are reviewed.
- **Level 4**: Recursive Oversight Board performs an **Audit of Epistemological Foundations**.

Eventually, your grade becomes a **quantum superposition** of A, B-, and *"Further Revision Required."*

## 🌀 The Recursive Principle

Nothing escapes review. Every reviewer is reviewed. Those reviews? Peer-reviewed again.

> **All reviews are subject to peer-review, recursively, until epistemological heat death.**

At PRU, justice, feedback, and disappointment are **version-controlled**, **comment-threaded**, and **exportable to BibTeX**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

PRU isn’t just a university — it’s an **academic simulation game running in real life**.  
Where:

- Grades are publications.
- Lunch has citations.
- And your emotional breakdown is a **case study in resilience theory** (under review).

So, would you like to enroll?

Please submit a **proposal, abstract, and three peer-reviewed recommendation letters**. And don’t forget — we’ll peer-review your peer-reviewed peer-review *before* we begin reviewing you.
