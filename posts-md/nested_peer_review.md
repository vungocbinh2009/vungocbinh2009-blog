Have you ever wondered: *What if peer reviewers were peer-reviewed too?*  
Welcome to the world of **Recursive Peer Review** — the academic equivalent of a hall of mirrors, but with more footnotes.

## 🔍 Level 1: A Modest Proposal

We started with a noble idea:  
> Let's make peer reviewers accountable by having *their* reviews reviewed.

Sounds good, right? More transparency, less bias, and better quality. What's the worst that could happen?

## 🌀 Level 2+: Infinite Reviewer Regression

But then, things spiraled:

- Reviewers need meta-reviewers.
- Meta-reviewers need meta-meta-reviewers.
- And so on...

> “Who reviews the review of the review of the review…?”

Result? A single paper now requires the attention of approximately **one small country’s worth** of academics.

## ⚠️ System Breakdown: When Review Becomes Religion

### 🕰️ Delaypocalypse
Publishing a paper now takes **6 years minimum** — or **12 recursive cycles**, whichever comes last.

### 🧠 Brain Drain
Reviewer burnout skyrockets. Faculty vanish. Some reportedly flee to industry.

### 📈 Bureaucracy Overload
Each submission includes:
- Your paper
- 3 reviews
- 3 meta-reviews
- 3 meta-meta reviews
- A spreadsheet of who judged whom
- An apology letter to your editor

## 🎩 But Wait — Let’s Review the Editors Too!

Why stop at reviewers?

Now we introduce **peer review of editors**.

- Was the editor fair?
- Did they cite enough meta-meta feedback?
- Was their response tone sufficiently compassionate?

The editor is judged. And their judges are judged. It's like the **Olympics of Accountability**, except with less cheering.

## 🧱 The Final Form: Academic Jenga

Every decision is built on dozens of other decisions. Pull one out, and the whole thing collapses.

Quote from the future:

> “Your paper was rejected because the meta-meta-reviewer of the editor's reviewer received a negative rating from their evaluator.”  
> – Recursive Review Committee, 2075

## 🧠 Moral of the Story

Accountability is good.  
Transparency is great.  
**Infinite recursion is how academia eats its own tail.**

Instead of:
- 🔁 Reviewing forever

Try:
- ✅ Capping recursion (1-2 layers)
- 🧠 Focusing on reviewer training
- 🌞 Making editorial decisions transparent

## 📝 Fake Paper Idea

**Title**: *Recursive Accountability in Peer Review Systems: An Exploration of Meta-Epistemic Loops and Practical Termination Conditions*

**Journal**: *The Journal of Satirical Research*

**Status**: Under Review. Recursively.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Let’s strive for better peer review.  
But maybe... let’s stop before we hit **meta-meta-meta-madness**.
