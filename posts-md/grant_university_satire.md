Welcome to the **University of Grantsylvania**, where knowledge is free, but existing costs a well-written grant proposal. No salaries, no professors, no permanent staff — just a swirling ecosystem of postdocs, PhD candidates, master's students, and now bachelor students, all scrambling to fund their next lecture, meal, or moment of academic dignity.

## Part 1: A Day in the Life (Postdoc Edition)

Linh, a PhD candidate, begins her day by checking the **Grant Dashboard**. She has no coffee access until her caffeine trial proposal is approved. Her class, "Linear Algebra Through Interpretive Dance," is peer-reviewed weekly. Groceries require a "Nutritional Research Justification Form." Every hour is either grant-writing, peer-reviewing someone else's application, or scavenging resources.

Sleep? Funded by a microgrant.

Her motto: *"If I teach well, I may get another postdoc. If I write well, I may get dinner."*

## Part 2: Student Life (Master’s & PhD Edition)

Master's and PhD students are the true labor force. They teach to build CVs, supervise undergrads, review grants, and occasionally learn. There's no curriculum — only a Discord server called **Academic Bazaar**, where students compete for enrollment via proposals.

Food is earned through participation in culinary studies. Dorms are co-funded experiments. Everyone belongs to grant alliances like *Team TensorFlow* or *The Fellowship of the Reviewer.*

Thesis topics include things like *"Game Theory Models of Resource Scarcity in Peer-Driven Class Allocation."*

## Part 3: Bachelor Students Enter the Arena

At last, the undergrads arrive. Young, hopeful, and utterly unprepared.

Bao, a second-year student, can’t register for classes — he must propose why he *deserves* to be taught. Cafeteria food is inaccessible without nutritional participation grants. One course he tries to join is full; another denies him because he failed to justify his desire to learn calculus.

In lieu of clubs, students form "grant guilds." They co-author microgrants to host events like "Intro to Sleep" or "Applied Sandwich Studies."

Their motto? **"Fake it ‘til you fund it."**

## Core Principles of Grantsylvania:

| Academic Need      | How It's Handled                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Teaching           | Must be grant-funded                      |
| Eating             | Requires research participation           |
| Class Registration | Competitive grant application             |
| Exams              | Only exist if funded                      |
| Curriculum         | Crowd-sourced and temporary               |
| Professors         | Replaced by rotating postdocs             |
| Stability          | None                                      |

## Key Consequences:

- **Hyper-Competition:** Everyone's a freelancer.
- **No Institutional Memory:** Courses vanish, knowledge evaporates.
- **Peer Review Overload:** Every decision is peer-reviewed — recursively.
- **Meritocracy Illusion:** Trendy fields thrive; essential but unfundable topics vanish.

---

## Final Thought:

The University of Grantsylvania saves the government money, optimizes productivity, and rewards only the grant-savvy. But it also produces fragile academics, weaponizes peer review, and turns students into pitch-deck warriors before they ever understand the subject.

A dystopia? A parody? Or a sneak preview of what's next?
